# cursor-control-using-IR-sensor
In this project we use a series of ir Tx-Rx pair  to locate [x,y] coordinates of the screen ,and move/drag the cursor accordingly.

# Arduino part
reads data from IR sensors
# Python part
uses this data via Serial Communication to manipulate cursor using pyautogui library
that all for now(work in progress)
